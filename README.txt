Welcome to Zachary's Sudoku Game!

Each row of the board must have a unique number from 1 to 9 and each column on the board must have a unique number from 1 to 9.
Every time you open the game window, it will produce a randomly generated board from easy to medium difficulty.

Select an empty space and type a number from 1 to 9 to 'pencil' in what you think may belong in that space.
If you think a number definitely belongs on the space you pencilled in, press ENTER to see if it works.

If you press ENTER on a space that doesn't take the number, you will accrue mistake marks on the bottom left of the screen.
For every 10 mistakes that are made, the counter on the very left of the mistake marks will go up by 1.  There is no limit in mistakes.

If you wish to stop playing, simply exit out of the window or press the SPACEBAR to let the game solve itself.  It may take a little time to process.
Once the board is filled, make sure you have a space selected and press ENTER to end the game and close the window.

Thank you and have fun!
